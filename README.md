# To Do list

A simple to do list made using JavaScript.

Building this I learned:
* How to store items in local storage
* That you can create classes for things that show up based on JavaScript (the delete button in this case)
* A bit more about JSON working with JavaScript
* How to avoid unwanted default actions on a click event with "return false"
* How to clear an input field
* How to add a list item, or bigger code chunks into HTML with JavaScript
